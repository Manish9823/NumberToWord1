Dr. Ambedkar College, Nagpur</font></b></center><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Founded by the visionary Late Padmashri Dadasahed Gaikwad in 1964, Dr. Ambedkar college, Nagpur (DACN), affiliated to Rashtrasant Tukadohi Maharaj Nagpur University, Nagpur is indeed a time-tested Center for higher learning. DACN is located in the center of the Orange city at the Holy Deeksha Bhoomi where Bharat Ratna Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, the architect of the indian Constitution, embraced Buddhism. DACN function under the aegis of Param Poojya Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Smarak Samiti.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late Shri. R. S. Gavai, (H. E. Hon'ble Governor of Bihar & Kerala) was the President of the college management till 2015. At present Bhadant Arya Nagarjun Shurei Sasai (President ) & Shri. S. j. Fulzele (Secretary) are the strong pillars of our institution. Under the direction of Dr. R. Krishnakumar, (Former Vice Chancellor, Yashwantrao Chauvan Maharashatra Open University, Nashik) we are integrated as a dedicated group of individuals always working hard to impart Quality Education to one and all.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DACN originally began with a vision of becoming a seat of excellence in education and took the first modest step in this direction in 1964 with the introduction of Arts and the Commerce faculties. Change of time, increasing inquisitive minds around the vicinity and explosion in scientific awareness encouraged us to introduce Science faculty in 1969. Those aspiring to  wear the fabled Black Coat to fight for justice were provided the right opportunity when DACN started Law faculty in 1982. To keep pace with time DACN also provided Management Education from 1984 when a separate Management Institute was established.
